# Customer Demographics and Shopping Behavior Analysis

# Targeting the Untapped Market (18-25 Age Group) with a New Credit Card

## Project Overview

This project aims to assess the feasibility and impact of launching a new credit card targeted specifically at customers aged 18-25. Using a combination of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and A/B testing, we analyze customer behavior and evaluate the effectiveness of this targeted campaign.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Analyzed customer demographics, credit card usage patterns, and product preferences.
  - Focused on the 18-25 age group, representing ~26% of the customer base.
  - Identified spending trends, credit limits, and common product categories.
  
- **A/B Testing**:
  - Formed control and test groups to evaluate the impact of a new credit card offer on transaction amounts.
  - Sample size determination based on statistical power and effect size.
  - Hypothesis testing to determine the effectiveness of the new credit card.

## Key Findings from EDA

- The 18-25 age group has a lower average income (< $50k) and limited credit history.
- Credit card usage is lower compared to other groups, with smaller average transaction amounts.
- Top spending categories: **Electronics**, **Fashion & Apparel**, and **Beauty & Personal Care**.

## A/B Testing Analysis

- **Hypothesis**: Introducing a new credit card will increase the average transaction amounts for the 18-25 age group compared to a control group.
- **Sample Size**: Determined to be 100 customers (50 in the test group and 50 in the control group).
- **Test Duration**: The campaign ran for 2 months, from 09-10-23 to 11-10-23.
- **Conversion Rate**: ~40% of the test group started using the new credit card.

### Hypothesis Testing

- **Z-score**: 2.7466 (positive, indicating potential success for the new card).
- **Critical Z-value**: 1.6448 (right-tailed test, 5% significance level).
- **p-value**: 0.0030 (less than 0.05, leading to rejection of the null hypothesis).

## Conclusion

The A/B testing results provide strong evidence that the new credit card targeted towards the 18-25 age group has a statistically significant impact on increasing average transaction amounts. 

## Next Steps

- Scale the campaign to a larger audience and refine targeting strategies based on insights from this test.
- Gather customer feedback to further tailor the credit card features.
- Provide educational resources to encourage responsible credit usage among younger customers.
