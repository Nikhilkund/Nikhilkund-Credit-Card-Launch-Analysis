# Customer Demographics and Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing customer data to understand shopping behaviors, with a focus on the age group 18-25. The project is divided into two phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. **Phase 2**: Statistical Analysis

## Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the first phase, we conducted an exploratory data analysis on the customer data to derive insights into the behavior of customers aged 18-25. Key findings include:

- **Customer Base**: The age group 18-25 accounts for ~26% of the customer base.
- **Annual Income**: The average annual income of this group is less than 50k.
- **Credit History**: They have limited credit history, which is reflected in lower credit scores and credit limits.
- **Payment Methods**: Usage of credit cards as a payment method is relatively low compared to other age groups.
- **Top Shopping Categories**:
  1. Electronics
  2. Fashion & Apparel
  3. Beauty & Personal Care

## Phase 2: Statistical Analysis

In the second phase, we will dive deeper into statistical analysis to validate the patterns and trends observed in Phase 1. This will involve hypothesis testing to accept the Null or recect the null.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For visualizations.
- **NumPy / SciPy**: For statistical analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data exploration.
